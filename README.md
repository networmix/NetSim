# NetSIM

ðŸš§ Work in progress! ðŸš§

![Python-test](https://github.com/networmix/NetSim/workflows/Python-test/badge.svg?branch=main) 

## Introduction
NetSim is planned to become a toolkit that could help network engineers (my friends and myself included) to better reason about the network designs.

Types of problems we want this toolkit to help solving (eventually):
* Flow analysis of a network graph with simulated failures
* Simulation of routing protocol behavior in stochastic environment

From a high level standpoint the system consists of few components:
* Workflow instructions
* Simple graph library
* Tool to build network graphs from their definitions
* Discrete event simulator
